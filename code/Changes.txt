3.0		- third version.
open_text_file.html
	- add this file to load txt file, and display text in <pre> tag.
		Sometimes in some browsers there is incorrect encoding for utf-8 encoded txt-files, when this opened by direct link.
		
chat.js:
	- add link to the txt-file with the message on the server, if text displaying incorrectly. Now this opened, with utf-8 encoding, using open_text_file.html

index.html:
	- increase maxlength, to be able to paste the long copy-paste. Now, default value is 3000 symbols, not 300.
	- add option to change maxLength for textarea, to be able to insert "copy and paste"
	- add option to enable or disable button. Now '\n' symbol (key Enter), is available inside textarea.
	- add script with function to working with two previous options.

about.html:
	- add link to "Article 19: Right to freedom of opinion and expression" and "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights": http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_19.html#at20
